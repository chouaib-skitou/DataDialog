# DataDialog
DataDialog is a React + TypeScript front-end client for creating and viewing structured conversation threads. Each message can include an optional **structured** section validated automatically against JSON Schemas, enabling rich interactions (forms, polls, schedules, etc.) without sacrificing the flexibility of a classic chat interface.
